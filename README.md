# billetera-criolla

Anyone could greatly benefit from getting to know DeFi, and it would be nice if their first encounter would be as easy as paying in a local shop using a tokenized asset of their local currency, or receiving their wage through a stream...

Billetera criolla aims to close the gap between the common Colombian people and descentralized finance, hoping that by doing this, they will be able to enter a whole new economy, a dangerous one, but full of opportunities and free of any restrictions imposed by centralized authorities.
